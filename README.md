#### **DO NOT RUN SCRIPTS YOU HAVE NOT READ.**

## `mkiso.sh`

Assuming you have the required programs installed 
in your chroot, this will zip up your rootfs and make it
into a bootable initrd `.iso` for use with `qemu`.

## `qemu.sh`

This will launch `qemu` with sane arguments to boot a `.iso` 
that you created with the script above.
